## FoodShare
A robust MVVM App to reduce household food wastage and combact hunger. 
This app enables Privileged users (Donors) to list surplus food items, while less privileged users (Guests) can claim these items. Volunteers then facilitate the free delivery of these items.

## Built using the following tech stack:

- Kotlin for Android.

- Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations.

- Firebase firestore for storing listed food items.

- Firebase Auth: Implemented email and passoword Auth

- ViewBinding which also improves the apps performance and makes interactions with UI safer.

## Features
There would be 3 categories of users:

**1) The Donors:** the users with excess or surplus food item who list them to be claimed by those (lets call them guests) that needs them.
↪ The donors would be able to:
- See the impact of their donation on society.

- List food items.

- See all listed items, both claimed, unclaimed, delivered and those on transit.

- See and redeem specific food request from guests.

- See real-time delivery tracking of their donation on map.


**2) The Guests:** those who need the food items listed by donors.
↪ The guests would be able to:
- See and browse food items listed by donors around them.

- Claim any food item that fits their needs.

- Make specific food request.

- See real-time ongoing delivery tracking of the food item they have claimed down to their doorstep.


**3) Volunteers:** these category of users would be responsible for handling the delivery of food items listed by donors to the guests.
↪ The Volunteers would be able to:
- Manage active delivery tasks (food items needed to be delivered).

- See tasks history.
